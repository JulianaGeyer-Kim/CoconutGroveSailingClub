Analysis:

    Domain:

        A sailing club owns a fleet of boats (sailing boats and power/coach boats). The club needs to track:
       - Purchase cost of each boat
       - Maintenance/repair expenses per boat
       - Enforce a strict rule: total expenses can’t exceed the original purchase price

        Boat
        BoatType
        Fleet
        FleetManagement
        User/Operator
        CSV File
        Fleetdata.db

    Actors (things that do stuff in the reality):
        Club manager--> views fleets, adds/removes boats, etc.
        System--> loads data, saves data, displays reports


    Function Points:
        Load fleet from CSV
        Load fleet from DB
        Save fleet to DB
        Print fleet to DB
        Print fleet report
        Add new boat
        Remove boat by name
        Request expense on boat
        Enforce spending limit

    Things that are done by non-actors:
        Serialization
        Parsing CSV lines
        Searching fleet by name
        Calculating remaining budget



    Scenarios:
        -	Scenario 1 (launch with CSV): User runs java FleetManagement FleetData.csv, system reads CSV, creates boat objects, adds all boats to the fleet ArrayList, shows menu, user prints fleet, sees al boats, user exits, data saved to FleetData.db
        -	Scenario 2 (normal – no arguments): User runs java FleetManagement, system loads fleet from FleetData.db, menu appears, user adds a new boat, user tries to spend $8,000 on Speedy – approved, tries to spend $20,000 more – denied, user removes Ostia, exits, new state saved
        -	Scenario 3 (Invalid):
        -	Enter invalid CSV, error message
        -	Try to spend more then allowed, rejected with remaining amount
        -	Remove non-existent boat, can’t find boat


    Design

        Classes:
           Boat: core domain entity
           BoatType: enum
           FleetManagement: Controller + main method


        Data:

            Class Boat (variables):
                type (BoatType, object data, not final, private, accessible through getType(), not mutable)
                name (String, object data, not final, private, accessible through getName(), not mutable)
                year (int, object data, not final, private, accessible through getYear(), not mutable)
                makeModel (String, object data, not final, private, accessible through getMakeModel(), not mutable)
                length (int, object data, not final, private, accessible through getLength(), not mutable)
                purchasePrice (double, object data, not final, private, accessible through getPurchasePrice(), not mutable)
                expenses (double, object data, not final, private, accessible through getExpenses(), mutable)

            Enum BoatType constants:
                POWER (class data, enum, Implicitly final, public, not mutable)
                SAILING ((class data, enum, Implicitly final, public, not mutable)

            Class FleetManagement:
                fleet (class data, ArrayList<Boat>, final, private, no direct getter, mutable)
                keyboard (class data, Scanner, final, private, no getter, mutable)
                DB_FILE (class data, String, final, private, no getter, not mutable)


    Methods:

        Class Boat:
            Boat: ()
            getType()
            getName()
            getYear()
            getMakeModel()
            getLength()
            getPurchasePrice()
            getExpense()
            addExpense()
            getRemainingSpending()
            toString()

        Class FleetManagement:
            main()
            loadFromCSV()
            loadFromDB()
            saveToDB()
            printFleet()
            addBoat()
            removeBoat()
            handleExpense()
            menuLoop()
